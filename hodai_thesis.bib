  abstract     = {The article presents two Matlab-based tools for analysis andsimulation of real-time control systems: Jitterbug andTrueTime.Jitterbug allows the user to compute aquadratic performance criterion for a linear control system undervarious timing conditions. The control system is described using anumber of continuous- and discrete-time linear systems. Astochastic timing model with random delays is used to describe theexecution of the system. The tool can also be used to investigateaperiodic controllers, multirate controllers, and jitter-compensatingcontrollers.TrueTime facilitates event-based co-simulation of amultitasking real-time kernel containing controller tasks and thecontinuous dynamics of controlled plants. The simulations capture thetrue, timely behavior of real-time controller tasks and communicationnetworks, and dynamic control and scheduling strategies can beevaluated from a control performance perspective. The controllers canbe implemented as Matlab functions, C functions, or ordinarydiscrete-time Simulink blocks.A number of examples that illustrate the use of the tools are given.},

        abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can
be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives
such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved.
Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted
repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop
system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates
the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers
to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating
envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation
of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules.
Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a
modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents,
software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen
that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve
transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID
control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system
identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID
systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to
a useful degree. This should also assist future development of
"plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and
can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity,
improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},
