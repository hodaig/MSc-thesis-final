I would first like to thank my supervisor Dr. Gera Weiss.
He consistently allowed this research to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it.
The door to Gera's office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble.
I am thankful I was given the opportunity to work with Gera and learn from him, this thesis would not have been possible without his incredible help and unconditional support.

I would also like to thank Hanouch Efraim for his huge help in the lab, he guided me throughout the process of preparing the experiments and to put the drone in the air. Hanouch also help me to learn the basics of control theory. Without his guidance the experiments could not have been successfully conducted.

I would also like to thank Dr. Shai Arogati for his technical support and collaboration during this research.  

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study, starting from the primary school through my mechanical study and the first degree. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
